# Overview

There are many ways to study and prep for interviews. There are whole books on this subject. I like to survey data structures and common algorithmic problem solving techniques. I then focus on 2 things: implementing data structures in a programming language (doesn't matter which one) and solving some problems. 

## Visualizing Algorithms
- [Visualizing Algorithms](https://visualgo.net/en)

By far the best site ever on playing around with different data strutures. I really wish I found this while I was in school. Could've saved me an all nighter or two. :D

## Practicing Algorithms
When practicing problems I need automated feedback. So no textbook problem sets. Although there are a lot of classical computer science problems that you can learn a lot from. [Classical CS problems](https://classicproblems.com/)

 My requirements for choosing a platform is as follows:
1. It must be free.... There are paid platforms that focus specifically on interview prep. [Algo Expert](https://www.algoexpert.io/product) [leet code premium](https://leetcode.com/subscribe/?ref=lp_pl)
2. It must rank problems by difficulty
3. It must allow me to sort by algorithm technique. So if I want to focus on greedy algorithms then I want to filter on those problem types.

# My Approach

Top Coder has changed its interface....It is confusing and looks as it is geared more towards freelancers than as an online judge....

I will be probably sticking to Hacker Rank and Code Chef. I am already familiar with these judges and they have been around for many years...so lots of problems to solve.

Here is my approach:
1. Start with an overview of a data structure and write up some notes on it... I have a lot of algorithms books on my shelves just collecting dust.... time to re-read some of these. When it comes to data structures I want to reacquaint myself in what the data structure is... contigious or not and what properties does it have. For example, the difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree. I want to basic analysis of some of its methods and a rough idea on how to implement one and what kinds of problems does it solve. I will be staying away from mathmatical theory as for interview prep I am looking for practical application rather than theory.
2. I want to solve some problems.... 3 easy and at least 1 medium. 
3. For data structures the focus will be on implementing a method such as a traversal of a tree or a classic algorithm like Bellman Ford or Djkistra algorithm. 
4. For the algorithms technique the focus is just getting confortable with it and being at a point where I can recognize the patterns. Example: in order to get to dynamic programming I need to be first comfortable with recursion. 

## Data Structures:
1. Bit Manipulation (yes, I have been asked these types on an interview before)
2. linked lists (single, double linked)
3. stacks
4. queues
5. heaps 
6. priority queue
7. binary tree 
8. m-ary tree
9. graphs
10. *Bonus* maybe a special tree such as Red-black tree or trie.

## Algorithms
1. Recursion
2. Divide and Conquer
3. Branch and Bound
4. Greedy
5. Dynamic Programming
6. Graph
